# Personal Learning Plan
This is a note for my thoughts on how I want to and approach learning C in a
low-level way.

## What do I want to learn?
Some low level C program. That is it, nothing special or fancy, I don't event
know What I want to build and What I want to get out from this.

## Fundamental concepts
### Makefile and CMake
As I need to learn C properly, I better know how [Makefile][8] and [CMake][9]
work.

### How does C manage memory
Learn from like memory allocation, pointers, heap and stack. All these stuff.
[Tutorial](https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/148675821737/memory-allocators-101-write-a-simple-memory)

### Algorithm
Learn the entry level algorithm from [hello-algo][5].

## Real Life Project Practice
Some real practice to see how these fundamental concepts are implemented in
real life project.

### Write a shell in C
As we use shell a lot, I figure it will be fun to learn how shell was built.
[Write a Shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

### Regex
Two very short tutorial found online.

  1. [A Regular Expression Matcher][6]

  2. [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast][7]

### Learn to create a language
Learn something simple first, like
[build your own lisp][1]

### Database
Database seems like a really interesting way of getting start with handling
large data with designing different data structures.
Like [redis][3] and [SQL][2].

### Compiler
Learning how the compiler work will definitely help me understand how machine
or computer works.
[From source code to Machine code][4] teaches how a compiler is made.
